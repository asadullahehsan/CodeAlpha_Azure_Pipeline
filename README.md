# CI/CD Pipeline using Azure
A CI/CD pipeline built with Azure Pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring smooth execution while adhering to core DevOps principles in Azure. The pipeline utilizes **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** to store the API's Docker image, which is then deployed to **Azure App Service** for hosting.
